    ? Static
    * default
    * positioned in relation to elements
    * top, bottom, left, right, z-index have NO EFFECT

    ? Relative 
    * just like static

    * values are relative to its original static position 

    ? Absolute
    * remove the element from the flow
    * positions it relative to the parent container
    * if parent is static, it will move outside of the parent container
    * if parent is relative, it will move within the parent container
    * positioning defined by top, bottom, left, right, z-index

    ? Fixed 

    * like absolute
    * positioned to the viewport
    * doesn't move when scrolling
    * positioning defined by top, bottom, left, right, z-index
